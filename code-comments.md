# How to comment your code


Commenting a code is a mix of art and engineering. It's hard to find a good balance. Often we comment to much or too little. The rule of thumb is make a good code, rather than fallback to use comments.

Below we list a rules to guide you for commenting your code, that we get from [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/23/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments).

1. Comments should not duplicate the code.
2. Good comments do not excuse unclear code.
3. If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code.
4. Comments should dispel confusion, not cause it.
5. Explain unidiomatic code in comments.
6. Provide links to the original source of copied code.
7. Include links to external references where they will be most helpful.
8. Add comments when fixing bugs.
9. Use comments to mark incomplete implementations.
